            Because regular fried chicken can be elevated.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>Seasoning salt to taste</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine condensed soup, egg, and seasoning salt (be careful, as soup is already salted) in a shallow dish or bowl; mix well. Dip chicken in mixture and turn to coat completely. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix together flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken pieces, one at a time, in the bag, seal and shake to coat. Add more flour and cornstarch as necessary, but add them in equal parts.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Be sure to use enough oil to cover chicken pieces.</li>
                <li>Place coated chicken on a platter; allow to sit until outside becomes doughy (this is critical to ensure crispiness when fried). Once chicken coating is doughy, test oil by dropping a piece of coating into it; oil is ready if it starts to fry immediately.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, fry chicken pieces in hot oil until cooked through and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve.</li>
            </ol>
