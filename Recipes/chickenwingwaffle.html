<p>
    This strange (And <em>fantastic?</em>) dish will make you feel like you're in a KFC fever dream.</p>
<p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>24 chicken wings (drumettes only)</li>
    <li>1 cup Bisquick™ baking mix</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of cayenne sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of maple syrup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of melted butter</li>
    <li>Ranch/Blue cheese dressing (for dipping)</li>
    <li>Frying oil</li></ul>
    </p>

<p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil to 350°F. Pat wings dry and liberally season with salt and pepper. Fry the wings in 2 or 3 batches depending on the size of your fryer, for about 10 minutes each batch.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the batter by mixing the Bisquick™ with the milk and egg. Make the sauce by mixing the cayenne sauce with the syrup and butter.</li>
        <li>Toss the wings in the sauce then hold a wing by the handle and dip it into the batter to very lightly coat. the thinner the better! Put onto a hot waffle iron and press it down a bit to help that nice waffle pattern sear in.</li>
        <li>Serve the wings with ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping.</li></ol>
